a0 = 1.003 +/- 0.007
a1 = 0.175 +/- 0.044
a2 = -0.091 +/- 0.043


To the end of chapter 6.1 Results:
Had the sign of a2 been flipped, a2,lit would only be slightly out of range. To make sure there was no error in the sign, we plotted the fitted function with the sign of a2 changed (appendix figure XX a2flipped.png). It is clearly visible that this function does not fit with the measured data and the sign of a2 was calculated correctly.


To the end of chapter 5.2 Gaussian Fit:
Nevertheless, it supplied a cross-check in the sense that the scaler values behave roughly the same way as the ones obtained by the TAC-signal (see appendix section XX for an analysis of the data obtained by S2)


To the end of chapter 5.2 Gaussian Fit:
Since Scaler S1 was expected to measure the same value for each of the nine measurements, it was used to check for systematic errors (see section 6.2 Discussion of Error Sources)


To chapter 6.2 Error Sources:
To make an estimation of the systematic error in our experiment, we plotted the event rate measured by the scaler S1 for each of the nine measurements (see apendix XX). Since S1 is connected to the fixed detector $D_l$, it is expected to measure the same rate every time. However, it is visible that the rate registered by S1 increases over the course of the nine measurements (we started with $\theta = 180^{\circ}$, decreasing the angle in steps of $15^{\circ}$), with the first measurement clearly standing out. 

A linear fit (appendix, figure XX) shows an average increase of around $0.1\%$ per measurement. In addition to that, we can see an oscillation of our data points around the linear fit, which is especially strong in the first 4$-$5 measurements (angles $180^{\circ}$ down to $120^{\circ}$). Both of these effects lead to the conclusion that our experiment lacks stability, especially in the first half of the measurements (high angles). This also complies with the observation that our measured values for angles above $135^{\circ}$ do not correspond to the predicted angular correlation function well.

Appendix Chapter about S2:
(figure scalerdist.png)

The procedure described in section 5.3 was repeated for the data obtained by the scaler S2. For the coefficients ai we got:

a0 = 0.995 +/- 0.008
a1 = 0.161 +/- 0.049
a2 = -0.108 +/- 0.047

here a0,lit as well as a1,lit are within the range while a2,lit is notably out of range as before. A look at the plotted function in figure XX shows a similar result to the one presented in section 5.3.
